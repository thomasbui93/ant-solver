A lightweight **Golang** server that generates valid **subsequential anagrams** —
words that can be formed by taking letters from an input string **in order**, possibly skipping some.

🕹️ **Live demo:** [https://ant-solver.onrender.com](https://ant-solver.onrender.com)

## 🧩 Overview

`ant-solver` computes all **valid dictionary words** that can be formed as subsequences of a given input word.
Unlike full anagrams (which must use all letters exactly once), **subsequential anagrams** maintain the **relative letter order** but may skip letters.

For example, from `"tamponh"` you can form `"phantom"` by choosing letters in order (t → a → m → p → o → n → h).

---

## 💡 Example

Try it live:

**Request:**
```

[https://ant-solver.onrender.com/?q=tamponh](https://ant-solver.onrender.com/?q=tamponh)

````

**Response:**
```json
{
  "3": ["tam","pat","ton","tho","nth","mho","hop","poh","tao","ham","pom","pho","mot","oat","amp","nam","mat","hot","nap","pan","pah","hoa","han","mop","tom","ant","hat","pot","map","pam","moa","poa","top","not","hap","ohm","opt","tap","nat","tan","mon","hon","noh","apt","man","mna"],
  "4": ["mano","tamp","moat","math","atop","oath","phot","phon","atom","tanh","than","pont","thon","opah","path","phat","moan","mona","noma","pant","moth"],
  "5": ["toman","panto","month","manto"],
  "6": ["potman","tampon","topman"],
  "7": ["phantom"]
}
````

Each key corresponds to the **word length**, and values are the list of subsequential anagrams of that length.

## ⚙️ Features

* 🔍 Finds **all** valid subsequential anagrams from a dictionary
* ⚡ Fast and memory-efficient Go implementation
* 🌐 Simple HTTP API
* 🧱 Easily deployable (e.g. Render, Fly.io, Railway)
* 📦 No external dependencies beyond the Go standard library

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomasbui93/ant-solver.git
cd ant-solver
go build -o ant-solver .
```

---

## 🧭 Usage

Run the server locally:

```bash
./ant-solver
```

By default, it starts on port `3000`.

Example request:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/?q=example"
```

## 🔌 API

### `GET /`

**Query parameters:**

| Name | Type   | Required | Description                                          |
| ---- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `q`  | string | ✅        | Input string to generate subsequential anagrams from |

**Example:**

```
/?q=planet
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "3": ["ant", "tan", "pan"],
  "4": ["plan", "neat"],
  "5": ["plane", "plant"]
}
```

---

## 🧠 Design

### Algorithm

1. Load a dictionary of valid English words.
2. For each dictionary word, check if it can be **subsequenced** from the input string:

   * e.g., `"phantom"` is valid for `"tamponh"` because each letter appears in order.
3. Group results by word length for readability.

### Project Structure

```
internal/          # Core logic (dictionary loading, matcher)
assets/            # Word lists / static data
```
